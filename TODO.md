# TODO

## Testing

[x] Image can be stored in database after snapping photo
[x] Image/All images can be retrieved from database

## Modifying

[x] Instead of pushing a new page with the taken photo,
push a replacement

[x] Photo Editor Page automatically saves photo to database,
but we only want to save when the save button is pressed

## Creating

### Photo Editor Page

[x] Save image page w/ form
[x] TextFormField for image description
[x] Save & Discard button
[x] On save insert data into database

### Settings Page

[] Change theme (light/dark)
[] Change temperature (F/C)
[] Change time

## Notes

- Main page list view DOES refresh on new photos, but
  it needs to be freshly loaded.
  - i.e. click home button on app bar
